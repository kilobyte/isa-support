Package: &NAME&-support
Priority: optional
Description: prevent installation on processors without required instructions
 This is a mostly dummy package, whose only purpose is to detect the presence
 of &NAME&.  It refuses to install on inadequate processors, thus allowing
 specifying such a requirement as a dependency.
