# debhelper wants to add bogus Depends on debconf.  Even if debconf's use
# was unconditional, that'd be wrong as preinst needs Pre-Depends not Depends.
# There's no risk of failing to grab a new dependency in the future as an
# empty (save for preinst) package has no needs.

# It's not hardcoded, we just do _Pre_-Depends rather than Depends.
