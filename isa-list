# Recognized fields:
# "Name": the isa extension name, the package will be ${Name}-support
# "Architecture": archs to build the package on, wildcards are ok
# "Test": how to detect it, defaults to return !__builtin_cpu_supports("$Name");
#     If the test program dies (SIGILL/etc), that's ok, the answer is "no".

# gcc-6 has __builtin_cpu_supports("altivec") but it's not reliable: silently
# gives wrong answer on qemu, wrong versions of glibc, non-glibc, etc.
# Thus, let's use SIGILL instead.
